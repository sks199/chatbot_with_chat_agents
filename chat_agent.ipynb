            "\n",
            "- Age: 31\n",
            "- Gender: Male\n",
            "- Location of skin condition: Legs\n",

            "- Oozing or discharge: No\n",
            "- Duration of symptoms: A few days\n",

After gathering more information from the user, the chatbot updated the diagnosis scores, ultimately concluding that the user likely had eczema (94.78% probability) due to the presence of redness, itching, and moderate severity of symptoms.\n",

            "- Eczema (atopic dermatitis): Characterized by dry, itchy, and inflamed skin, which aligns with the user's symptoms.\n",
            "- Psoriasis: Although less likely (with a 5.12% probability), psoriasis could be considered as it also causes redness and itching.\n",
            "- Contact dermatitis: A possible diagnosis if the user had exposure to an allergen or irritant, but in this case, the user reported no such exposure.\n",
            "- Other skin conditions, such as folliculitis or keratosis pilaris, could be considered, but the user's symptoms do not strongly suggest these conditions.\n",

While the chatbot asked follow-up questions to gather more information, it could have explored other potential causes of the symptoms and considered alternative diagnoses. Additionally, the chatbot's final assessment and recommendation were somewhat limited, as it did not take into account potential individual factors, such as the user's medical history or potential allergies.\n",

The user's symptoms, including redness, itching, and moderate severity, are consistent with this diagnosis. However, I would recommend a more comprehensive evaluation, including a physical examination and potentially some diagnostic tests (e.g., skin scrapings or patch testing), to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes.\n",

            "The combination of the user's symptoms and the chatbot's updated diagnosis scores suggests that eczema is the most likely diagnosis. The user's age and lack of exposure to known allergens or irritants also support this diagnosis. While other skin conditions, such as psoriasis or contact dermatitis, could be considered, the user's symptoms are more consistent with eczema.\n",
            "\n",
            "I recommend that the user consult a dermatologist for a comprehensive evaluation and proper diagnosis. The dermatologist can assess the user's individual factors, medical history, and potential allergies to provide an accurate diagnosis and develop a personalized treatment plan.\n"
